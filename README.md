# Axoflow-IdP

A lightweight OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider, designed to work seamlessly with Axoflow.

## Overview

Axoflow-IdP is a simple yet feature-rich OIDC provider that enables authentication for your applications. It supports multiple clients, user self-registration, administrative user management, and JWT-based token signing. The provider implements standard OIDC endpoints including authorization, token exchange, and JWKS discovery.

## Quickstart

1. Create a `config.json` file with your OIDC clients and base URL:

```json
{
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
    "clients": [
    {
        "id": "your-client-id",
        "redirectUri": "http://localhost:3000/callback"
    }
    ],
    "signingKey": {
        "filePath": "signing-key.pem",
        "generateIfMissing": true
    }
}
```

2. Run the IdP:

```bash
go run main.go
```

3. The IdP will be available at `http://localhost:8080` with OIDC discovery at `/.well-known/openid-configuration`

> `baseUrl` may include a path, e.g. `https://sso.example.com/idp`. The IdP then
> serves every page, every OIDC endpoint and the discovery document under that
> prefix, and advertises it as the `issuer`. A reverse proxy in front of it must
> pass the prefix through rather than strip it, and health/readiness probes must
> target the prefix root (`/idp/`) — outside the prefix everything is 404.
> A trailing slash in `baseUrl` is trimmed, so `https://host/` and `https://host`
> both yield the issuer `https://host`; relying parties that pinned an issuer
> string ending in `/` must drop the slash.

> `redirect_uri` is matched by **exact string comparison** against a client's
> registered URIs at both `/oidc/auth` and `/token`. Register additional
> callbacks with a `redirectUris` array alongside (or instead of) the singular
> `redirectUri`; any request whose `redirect_uri` is not an exact match is
> rejected.
